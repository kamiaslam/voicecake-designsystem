# Src Directory Structure Migration

## Overview
This project has been successfully migrated from a flat directory structure to a `src/` directory structure for better organization and maintainability.

## What Was Moved

### Source Directories (moved to `src/`)
- `app/` → `src/app/` - Next.js app router pages and layouts
- `components/` → `src/components/` - Reusable React components
- `hooks/` → `src/hooks/` - Custom React hooks
- `lib/` → `src/lib/` - Utility functions and data
- `types/` → `src/types/` - TypeScript type definitions
- `templates/` → `src/templates/` - Page templates and layouts
- `mocks/` → `src/mocks/` - Mock data for development
- `contstants/` → `src/contstants/` - Application constants

### Root Level (kept in place)
- `public/` - Static assets (images, fonts, etc.)
- `next.config.js` - Next.js configuration
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration
- `package.json` - Dependencies and scripts
- `eslint.config.mjs` - ESLint configuration
- `postcss.config.mjs` - PostCSS configuration

## Configuration Updates

### TypeScript Paths
The `tsconfig.json` has been updated to reflect the new structure:
```json
{
  "paths": {
    "@/*": ["./src/*"]
  }
}
```

### Font Paths
Font import paths in `src/app/layout.tsx` have been updated from:
```typescript
path: "../public/fonts/..."
```
to:
```typescript
path: "../../public/fonts/..."
```

## Benefits of the New Structure

1. **Better Organization**: All source code is now contained within the `src/` directory
2. **Cleaner Root**: The project root is now cleaner with only configuration files
3. **Standard Practice**: Follows common industry practices for React/Next.js projects
4. **Easier Navigation**: Developers can quickly identify source code vs configuration
5. **Scalability**: Better structure for growing projects

## Import Aliases
The `@/` import alias continues to work exactly as before:
- `@/components/Button` → `src/components/Button`
- `@/lib/data` → `src/lib/data`
- `@/types/user` → `src/types/user`

## Verification
- ✅ Build process works (`npm run build`)
- ✅ Development server works (`npm run dev`)
- ✅ All imports resolve correctly
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing code

## Next Steps
The migration is complete and no further action is required. Your development workflow remains the same, but now with a cleaner, more organized project structure.
